Not all the information in a turbulent ﬁeld is relevant for understanding particular regions
or variables in the ﬂow. Here, we present a method for decomposing a source ﬁeld into its
informative Φ I(x, t) and residual Φ R(x, t) components relative to another target ﬁeld. The
method is referred to as informative and non-informative decomposition (IND). All the
necessary information for physical understanding, reduced-order modelling and control of
the target variable is contained in Φ I(x, t), whereas Φ R(x, t) offers no substantial utility
in these contexts. The decomposition is formulated as an optimisation problem that seeks
to maximise the time-lagged mutual information of the informative component with the
target variable while minimising the mutual information with the residual component.
The method is applied to extract the informative and residual components of the velocity
ﬁeld in a turbulent channel ﬂow, using the
wall shear stress as the target variable. We
demonstrate the utility of IND in three scenarios: (i) physical insight into the effect
of the velocity ﬂuctuations on the wall shear stress; (ii) prediction of the wall shear
stress using velocities far from the wall ; and (iii) development of control strategies for
drag reduction in a turbulent channel ﬂow using opposition control. In case (i), IND
reveals that the informative velocity related to wall shear stress consists of wall-attached
high- and low-velocity streaks, collocated with regions of vertical motions and weak
spanwise velocity. This informative structure is embedded within a larger-scale streak–roll
structure of residual velocity, which bears no information about the wall shear stress. In
case (ii), the best-performing model for predicting wall shear stress is a convolutional
neural network that uses the informative component of the velocity as input, while the
residual velocity component provides no predictive capabilities. Finally, in case (iii), we
demonstrate that the informative component of the wall-normal velocity is closely linked

1. Introduction
Since the early days of turbulence research, there have been multiple attempts to
decompose the ﬂow into different components to facilitate its physical understanding,
control its behaviour and devise reduced-order models. One of the earliest examples
is the Reynolds decomposition (Reynolds 1895), which divides the velocity ﬁeld into
its mean and ﬂuctuating components. More sophisticated approaches rapidly emerged ,
aiming at extracting the coherent structure of the ﬂow through correlations and
structure identiﬁcation (Robinson 1991;P a n t o n2001;A d r i a n2007; Smits, McKeon &
Marusic 2011; McKeon 2017; Jiménez 2018). This interest is justiﬁed by the hope that
insights into the dynamics can be gained by analysing a subset of the entire ﬂow,
while the remaining incoherent ﬂow plays only a secondary role in understanding the
overall dynamics. In this work, we introduce a method to decompose turbulent ﬂow
ﬁelds into informative and non-informative components, referred to as
informative and
non-informative decomposition (IND), such that the informative component contains all
the useful information for physical understanding, modelling and control with respect to a
given quantity of interest.
The quest to divide turbulent ﬂows in terms of coherent and incoherent motions
has a long history, tracing back to the work of Theodorsen ( 1952), and has been a
subject of active research since the pioneering experimental visualisations of Kline
et al. (1967) and the identiﬁcation of large-scale coherent regions in mixing layers by
Brown & Roshko ( 1974). Despite this rich history, the ﬁeld still lacks consensus about
the deﬁnition of a coherent structure due to the variety of interpretations proposed
by different researchers. One of the initial approaches to distinguish turbulent regions
was the turbulent/
non-turbulent discriminator circuits introduced by Corrsin & Kistler
(1954). Since then, single- and two-point correlations have become conventional tools for
identifying coherent regions within the ﬂow (e.g. Sillero, Jiménez & Moser 2014). The
development of more sophisticated correlation techniques, such as the linear stochastic
estimation (Adrian & Moin 1988) – together with its extensions (Tinney et al. 2006;
Baars & Tinney 2014; Encinar & Jiménez 2019) – and the characteristic-eddy approach
(Moin & Moser 1989), has further improved our understanding of the coherent structure of
turbulence. An alternative set of methods focuses on decomposing the ﬂow into localised
regions where certain quantities of interest are particularly intense. The ﬁrst attempts,
dating back to the 1970s, include the variable-interval time average method (Blackwelder
&K a p l a n1976) for obtaining temporal structures of bursting events
, and its modiﬁed
version, the variable-interval space average method (Kim 1985) for characterising spatial
rather than temporal structures. With the advent of larger databases and computational
resources, more reﬁned techniques have emerged to extract three-dimensional, spatially
localised ﬂow structures. These include investigations into regions of rotating ﬂuid (e.g.
vortices; Moisy & Jiménez 2004; Del Álamo et al. 2006), motions carrying most of the
kinetic energy (e.g. regions of high- and low-velocity streaks; Hwang & Sung 2018;B a e
&L e e2021), and those responsible for most of the momentum transfer in wall turbulence
(e.g. quadrant events and uniform momentum zones ; Meinhart & Adrian 1995; Adrian,

Meinhart & Tomkins 2000; Lozano-Durán, Flores & Jiménez 2012; Lozano-Durán &
Jiménez 2014; de Silva, Hutchins & Marusic 2016; Wallace 2016).
The methods described above offer a local-in-space characterisation of coherent
structures, in contrast to the global-in-space modal decompositions of turbulent ﬂows
(Taira et al. 2017, 2020). One of the ﬁrst established global-in-space methods is the proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) (Lumley 1967), wherein the ﬂow is decomposed into
a series of eigenmodes that optimally reconstruct the energy of the ﬁeld. This method
has evolved in different directions, such as space-only POD (Sirovich 1987), spectral
POD (Towne, Schmidt & Colonius 2018)
and conditional POD (Schmidt & Schmid
2019), to name a few. Another popular approach is dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)
(Schmid 2010;S c h m i det al. 2011), along with decompositions based on the spectral
analysis of the Koopman operator (Rowley et al. 2009; Mezi ´c 2013). Similar to POD,
various modiﬁcations of DMD have been developed, e.g. the extended DMD (Williams,
Kevrekidis & Rowley 2015), the multi-resolution DMD (Kutz, Fu & Brunton 2016), and
the high-order DMD (Le Clainche & Vega 2017)( s e eS c h m i d(2022) for a review). The
POD and DMD methods do not explicitly account for nonlinear interactions. To overcome
this, extensions to detect quadratic nonlinear interactions based on the bispectrum have
also been developed (Baars & Tinney 2014;S c h m i d t2020). Another noteworthy modal
decomposition approach is empirical mode decomposition, ﬁrst proposed by Huang et al.
(1998) and recently used in the ﬁeld of ﬂuid mechanics (e.g. Cheng et al. 2019). While
the methods listed above are purely data-driven, other modal decompositions, such as
resolvent analysis and input–output analysis, are grounded in the linearised Navier–Stokes
equations (Trefethen et al. 1993; Jovanovi´c & Bamieh 2005; McKeon & Sharma 2010).
It has been shown that POD, DMD and resolvent analysis are equivalent under certain
conditions (Towne et al. 2018). Recently, machine learning has opened new opportunities
for nonlinear modal decompositions of turbulent ﬂows (Brunton, Noack & Koumoutsakos
2020).
The ﬂow decomposition approaches presented above, either local or global in space,
have greatly contributed to advancing our knowledge about the coherent structure of
turbulence. Nonetheless, there are still open questions, especially regarding the dynamics
of turbulence, that cannot be answered easily by current methodologies. Part of these
limitations stems from the linearity of most methods, yet turbulence is a nonlinear system.
A more salient issue perhaps lies in the fact that current methods (with exceptions, such as
the extended POD ; Borée 2003) tend to focus on decomposing source variables without
accounting for other target variables of interest. In general, it is expected that different
target variables would require different decomposition approaches of the source variable.
For example, we might be interested in a decomposition of the velocity that is useful for
understanding the
wall shear stress. Hence the viewpoint adopted here aims to answer
the question: what part of the ﬂow is relevant to understanding the dynamics of another
variable? In this context, coherent structures are deﬁned as those containing the useful
information needed to understand the evolution of a target variable.
The concept of information alluded to above refers to the Shannon information (Shannon
1948; Cover & Thomas 2006), i.e. the average unpredictability in a random variable. The
systematic use of information-theoretic tools for causality, modelling and control in ﬂuid
mechanics has been discussed recently by Lozano-Durán & Arranz (2022). Betchov (1964)
was one of the ﬁrst authors to propose an information-theoretic metric to quantify the
complexity of turbulence. Some works have leveraged Shannon information to analyse
different aspects of two-dimensional turbulence and energy cascade models (Cerbus
& Goldburg 2013; Materassi et al. 2014; Granero-Belinchon 2018; Shavit & Falkovich

2020;L e e 2021; Tanogami & Araki 2024). Information theory has also been used for
causal inference in turbulent ﬂows (Liang & Lozano-Durán 2016; Lozano-Durán, Bae &
Encinar 2019;W a n get al. 2021; Lozano-Durán & Arranz 2022; Martínez-Sánchez et al.
2023), and reduced-order modelling (Lozano-Durán et al. 2019). The reader is referred
to Lozano-Durán & Arranz ( 2022) for a more detailed account of the applications of
information-theoretic tools in ﬂuid mechanics.
This work is organised as follows . The formulation of the ﬂow decomposition into
informative and non-informative components is introduced in§ 2: we ﬁrst discuss the exact
formulation of IND in §§ 2.1 and 2.2, followed by its numerically tractable approximation,
aIND, in § 2.3. Section 3 demonstrates the application of the method to the decomposition
of the velocity ﬁeld, using wall shear stress in a turbulent channel ﬂow as the target
variable. This decomposition is leveraged for physical understanding, prediction of the
wall shear stress using velocities away from the wall via convolutional neural networks,
and drag reduction through opposition control. Finally, conclusions are presented in § 4.
2. Methodology
2.1. The IND of the source variable
Let us denote the source variable by Φ(x, t),w i t h x ∈ Ω Φ , and the target variable
by Ψ (x, t),w i t h x ∈ Ω Ψ , where x and t represent the spatial and time coordinates,
respectively. For example, in the case of a turbulent channel ﬂow, the source variable
could be the velocity ﬂuctuations deﬁned over the entire domain, Φ(x, t) = u(x, t),
and the target variable could be the shear stress vector at every point over one of the
walls, Ψ (x, t) = τ
w(x, t), as shown in ﬁgure 1 . We seek to decompose Φ(x, t) into two
independent contributions: an informative contribution to the target variable in the future,
Ψ + = Ψ (x, t + /Delta1T) with /Delta1T ≥ 0, and a residual term that conveys no information about
Ψ + (i.e. the non-informative component):
Φ(x, t) = Φ I(x, t) + Φ R(x, t), (2.1)
where Φ I and Φ R are the informative and residual contributions, respectively. The
decomposition is referred to as IND.
To ﬁnd a decomposition of the form shown in ( 2.1), we need to introduce a deﬁnition
of information. We rely on the concept of Shannon information (Shannon 1948), which
1000 A95-4

quantiﬁes the average information in the variable Ψ+ as
H(Ψ +) =−
∑
S∈S
pΨ +(Ψ + = S) log pΨ +(Ψ + = S) ≥ 0, (2.2)
where H(Ψ +) is referred to as the Shannon entropy or information of Ψ +, pΨ +(Ψ + = S)
denotes the probability of Ψ + b e i n gi nt h es t a t eS,a n dS represents the set of all possible
states of Ψ +. The remaining information in Ψ +, after discounting for the information in
Φ , is measured by the conditional Shannon information:
H(Ψ + | Φ) =−
∑
S∈S
∑
R∈R
pΨ +,Φ (S, R) log pΨ +,Φ (S, R)
pΦ (R) ≥ 0, (2.3)
where pΨ +,Φ is the joint probability distribution of Ψ + and Φ , R is a particular state of
Φ ,a n d R is the set of all possible states of Φ . The difference between ( 2.2)a n d( 2.3)
quantiﬁes the amount of shared information between the variables ,
I(Ψ +; Φ) = H(Ψ +) − H(Ψ + | Φ), (2.4)
and is referred to as the mutual information between Ψ + and Φ . The condition H(Ψ +) ≥
H(Ψ + | Φ) – known as ‘information can’t hurt’ (Cover & Thomas 2006) – guarantees that
I(Ψ +; Φ) is always non-negative. The mutual information is equal to 0 only when the
variables are independent, i.e. pΨ +,Φ (S, R) = pΨ +(S) pΦ (R) for all possible states S ∈ S
and R ∈ R.
We are now in a position to deﬁne the conditions that Φ I and Φ R must satisfy. First, the
informative contribution should maximise I(Ψ+; Φ I) from (2.4), which is achieved when
I(Ψ +; Φ I) = H(Ψ +), (2.5)
namely, Φ I contains all the information in Ψ +. Equation (2.5) can be rewritten using ( 2.4)
as
H(Ψ + | Φ I) = 0, (2.6)
which is mathematically equivalent to expressing Ψ+ as a function of Φ I , namely, Ψ + =
F(Φ I). Second, the residual term Φ R and the informative term Φ I must be independent,
which requires
I(Φ R; Φ I) = 0. (2.7)
This also ensures that the residual component has no information about Ψ +, namely
I(Φ R; Ψ +) = 0, since I(Φ R; Ψ +) ≤ I(Φ R; Φ I). The previous inequality is known as the
data-processing inequality, and states that no transformation of a variable can increase its
information content, which can only remain the same or decrease (Cover & Thomas 2006,
Theorem 2.8.1). In addition, since Φ R and Φ I are statistically independent from ( 2.7), the
equality
∥Φ∥2 =∥ Φ I∥2 +∥ Φ R∥2 (2.8)
is satisﬁed. If Φ contains no information about Ψ +,t h e n ∥Φ I∥2/∥Φ∥2 ≈ 0 and
∥Φ R∥2/∥Φ∥2 ≈ 1. Conversely, if Φ exclusively contains all the information necessary to
understand Ψ +,t h e n∥Φ I∥2/∥Φ∥2 = 1. Note that, in general, Φ I , Φ R and F are functions
of /Delta1T, which has been omitted here for the sake of simplicity in the notation.
Since the Shannon information is based on the joint probability distribution of the
variables, rather than their speciﬁc values, there may exist many functions that satisfy

G. Arranz and A. Lozano-Durán
(2.5)a n d(2.7). To identify a unique solution, we impose that the informative ﬁeld Φ I(x, t)
is smooth. Note that, assuming Φ(x, t) is smooth, the previous condition also implies that
the residual ﬁeld must be smooth.
In summary, the necessary conditions that IND satisﬁes are as follows.
(i) The source variable is decomposed as the sum of the informative and residual
contributions: Φ = Φ I + Φ R (2.1).
(ii) The informative ﬁeld contains all the information about the target variable in the
future: I(Ψ +; Φ I) = H(Ψ +) (2.5).
(iii) The informative and residual components share no information: I(Φ R; Φ I) = 0
(2.7).
(iv) The informative ﬁeld is smooth.
2.2. The IND of the target variable
Alternatively, we can seek to decompose the target variable as Ψ = Ψ I + Ψ R, where Ψ I
and Ψ R are, respectively, the informative and residual components of Ψ with respect to
Φ− = Φ(x, t − /Delta1T),w i t h/Delta1T > 0. The constraints to be satisﬁed are
I(Φ− ; Ψ I) = H(Φ− ), I(Ψ R; Ψ I) = 0, (2.9a,b)
together with the smoothness of Ψ I . In this case, Ψ I corresponds to the part of Ψ that
can explain the source variable Φ in the past, while Ψ R is the remaining term, which is
agnostic to the information in the source variable.
2.3. Approximate IND
We frame the conditions of IND described in § 2.1 as a minimisation problem. To that end,
several assumptions are adopted. First, (2.5)a n d(2.7) require calculating high-dimensional
joint probability distributions, which might be impractical due to limited data and
computational resources. The curse of
high dimensionality comes from both the high
dimensionality of Φ and Ψ , and the large number of points in x. To make the problem
tractable, we introduce the approximate IND, or aIND for short. First, the source and target
variables are restricted to be scalars, Φ and Ψ , respectively. Second, we consider only two
points in space: Φ( x, t) and Ψ+(x − /Delta1x, t + /Delta1T), where x and /Delta1x are ﬁxed. This reduces
the problem to the computation of two-dimensional joint probability distributions, which
is trivially affordable in most cases, even enabling the use of experimental data.
Another difﬁculty arises from the constraint in ( 2.7), which depends on the unknown
probability distribution of the variable ΦR = Φ − ΦI , which adds to the complexity of the
optimisation problem. To alleviate this issue, we seek to minimise I(ΦR;ΦI) rather than
include it as a hard constraint.
Finally, provided that Φ and Ψ+ are smooth, minimising ∥Φ − ΦI∥2 ensures that ΦI
is smooth too. Therefore, we include the mean square error as a penalisation term in the
minimisation problem. Thus the formulation of the aIND is posed as
arg min
ΦI,F
I(ΦR;ΦI) + γ∥Φ − ΦI∥2, s.t.Ψ + = F(ΦI), (2.10)
where γ ≥ 0 is a regularisation constant ,a n dΦR = Φ − ΦI . Equation ( 2.10)i ss o l v e db y
assuming that the mapping F is invertible over a given interval. This allows replacing
ΦI(t) = F− 1(Ψ+(t)) over that interval in ( 2.10) and solving for F− 1 using standard
optimisation techniques. More details about the solution of ( 2.10) are provided in § A.1.

IND of turbulent ﬂow ﬁelds
Equation (2.10) yields the informative and residual components for a given x, /Delta1x and t,
denoted as ΦI,Δ (x, t;/Delta1x) and ΦR,Δ (x, t;/Delta1x), together with the mapping F. We can ﬁnd
the best approximation to IND by selecting the value of /Delta1x that maximises the informative
component. To that end, we introduce the relative energy of ΦI,Δ as
EI(/Delta1x; x,/Delta1T) = ∥ΦI,Δ ∥2
∥Φ ∥2 . (2.11)
High values of EI deﬁne the informative region of ΦI,Δ over Ψ+, and constitute the
information-theoretic generalisation of the two-point linear correlation (see Appendix C).
We deﬁne /Delta1xmax as the shift /Delta1x that maximises EI for a given x and /Delta1T. Hence we use
/Delta1x = /Delta1xmax for aIND, and simply refer to the variables in this case as ΦI and ΦR. During
the optimisation, we ensure that 2 I(ΦI;ΦR)< 0.03 H(ΦI,Φ R) to guarantee that ΦI and
ΦR are independent, and that ( 2.8) holds. We also assess a posteriori that I(ΦR;Ψ+)
remains small for all x (see Appendix E).
Finally, we list below the main simpliﬁcations of aIND with respect to the general IND
framework.
(i) The source and the target variable are restricted to be scalars.
(ii) The constraint in ( 2.7) is cast as the minimisation term in ( 2.10).
(iii) The minimisation problem in ( 2.10) is computed for two points in space. The closest
approximation to IND is achieved by selecting the value of /Delta1x that maximises the
magnitude of the informative component.
(iv) Equation ( 2.10) is solved by assuming that the mapping F is invertible over a given
interval.
Despite the simpliﬁcations above, aIND still successfully recovers the exact analytical
solution in the validation cases presented in Appendix B , even outperforming
correlation-based methods such as linear stochastic estimation (LSE) and extended POD
(EPOD).
2.4. Validation
The methodology presented in § 2.1 and its numerical implementation ( § A.1)h a v eb e e n
validated with several analytical examples. In this subsection, we discuss one of these
examples that also illustrates the use and interpretation of the IND.
Consider the source and target ﬁelds:
source Φ( x, t) = f(x, t) + g(x, t), (2.12)
target Ψ+(x, t) = Ψ( x, t + 1) = 0.5 f(x, t)2 − 0.2 f(x, t) + ϵ(x, t), (2.13)
where
f(x, t) = 2 sin(2πx − 2t) sin(2πy), (2.14)
g(x, t) = 1
5 sin(7
√
2 πx − 0.1t) sin(8
√
3 πy − 0.5t). (2.15)
The source ﬁeld is a combination of the streamwise travelling wave f and the lower
amplitude, higher wavenumber travellingwave g. The target is a function of f and ϵ, where
the latter is a random variable that follows the pointwise normal distribution with zero
mean and standard deviation ( σ) equal to 0.1: ϵ(x, t) ∼ N(0,σ) . Snapshots of Φ and Ψ
are shown in ﬁgures 2(a,b), respectively.

The results of solving the optimisation problem using aIND, denoted by ΦI , ΦR and
F, are displayed in ﬁgures 2 (c–e). It can be observed that ΦI approximates well the
travelling wave represented by Φ exact
I = f . The small differences between ΦI and Φ exact
I ,
also appreciable in ΦR, are localised at values f ≈ 0.2 and can be explained by the
small discrepancies between F and Fexact at the minimum , as seen in ﬁgure 2(e). These
are mostly a consequence of ϵ and the numerical implementation (see § A.1), and they
diminish as σ → 0. Additional validation cases, together with a comparison of aIND with
EPOD and LSE, can be found in Appendix B.
3. Results
We study the aIND of the streamwise ( u), wall-normal ( v) and spanwise ( w) velocity
ﬂuctuations in a turbulent channel ﬂow using as target the streamwise component of the
shear stress at the wall, τx(x, z, t) = ρν ∂U(x, 0, z, t)/∂y, where ρ is the ﬂuid density, ν
is the kinematic viscosity, U is the instantaneous streamwise velocity ,a n d x, y and z are
the streamwise, wall- normal and spanwise directions, respectively. The wall is located
at y = 0. The data are obtained from direct numerical simulations in a computational
domain of size 8πh × 2h × 4πh in the streamwise, wall- normal and spanwise directions,
respectively, where h represents the channel half-height. The ﬂow is driven by a constant

u(x, t) = uI(x, t) + uR(x, t), (3.3)
v(x, t) = vI(x, t) + vR(x, t), (3.4)
w(x, t) = wI(x, t) + wR(x, t), (3.5)
where the informative and residual components are also functions of /Delta1T. We focus our
analysis on /Delta1T∗ ≈ 25 unless otherwise speciﬁed. This value corresponds to the time shift
at which H(τx,+ | τx)/H(τx,+) ≳ 0.97, meaning that τx,+ shares no signiﬁcant information
with its past. For /Delta1T∗ > 25, the value of H(τx,+ |τx) gradually increases towards H(τx,+)
asymptotically. This value is similar to that reported by Zaki & Wang ( 2021), who found
using adjoint methods that wall observations at /Delta1T∗ ≈ 20 are the most sensitive to
upstream and near-wall velocity perturbations. The shifts /Delta1xmax
□ = [/Delta1xmax

□ ]f o r
□ = u, v or w are computed by a parametric sweep performed in Appendix D. Their values
are functions of y, but can be approximated as /Delta1xmax
u /h ≈ [− 1, 0], /Delta1xmax
v /h ≈ [− 1.2, 0]
and /Delta1xmax
w /h ≈ [− 0.8, ±0.15]. Due to the homogeneity and statistical stationarity of the
ﬂow, the mapping F is a function of only y and /Delta1T. The validity of the approximations
made in the aIND is discussed in Appendix E , where it is shown that the residual
component of u contains almost no information about the future wall shear stress. For
the interested reader, we also include the relative energy ﬁeld EI(/Delta1x; x,/Delta1T∗ = 25) of the
three velocity components in Appendix D.
3.1. Coherent structure of the informative and residual components of u ,v and w to τx
We start by visualising the instantaneous informative and residual components of the ﬂow.
We focus on the streamwise component, as it turns out to be the most informative to τx,
as detailed below. Figure 3 (a) displays iso-surfaces of u(x, t), revealing the alternating
high- and low-velocity streaks attached to the wall , along with smaller detached regions.
The informative and residual components uI(x, t) and uR(x, t) are shown in ﬁgures 3(b,c),
respectively. The structures inuI exhibit an alternating pattern similar to that in the original
ﬁeld, with the high- and low-velocity streaks located approximately in the same positions
as u(x, t). These structures are also attached to the wall , but do not extend as far as
the streaks in the original ﬁeld, especially for uI(x, t)> 0. In contrast, the residual ﬁeld
uR(x, t) lacks most of the elongated streaks close to the wall , but resembles u(x, t) far
away, once the ﬂow bears barely no information about τx,+.
Figure 4 displays the root mean squared turbulence intensities as functions of the
wall distance. Note that from the minimised term in ( 2.10), ⟨u2⟩( y) =⟨ u2
I ⟩( y) +⟨ u2
R⟩( y)
(and similarly for the other components). From ﬁgure 4 (a), we observe that ⟨u2
I ⟩1/2 is
predominantly located within the region y∗ ≤ 50. This ﬁnding aligns with our earlier

presence close to the wall, although it is shifted towards larger values of y. Interestingly,
about half of the streamwise kinetic energy in the near-wall region originates from ⟨u2
R⟩,
despite its lack of information about τx,+. This phenomenon is akin to the inactive motions
in wall turbulence (e.g. Townsend 1961; Jiménez & Hoyas 2008; Deshpande, Monty &
Marusic 2021), with the difference that here inactive structures are interpreted as those

that do not reﬂect time variations of the wall shear stress. Another interesting observation
is that ⟨u2
I ⟩1/2 peaks at y∗ ≈ 10, which is slightly below the well-known peak for ⟨u2⟩1/2,
whereas ⟨u2
R⟩1/2 peaks at y∗ ≈ 30. This suggests that the near-wall peak of ⟨u2⟩1/2 is
controlled by a combination of active and inactive motions as deﬁned above.
The root mean squared velocities for the cross-ﬂow are shown in ﬁgures 4 (b,c). The
informative component of the wall-normal velocity ⟨v2
I ⟩1/2 is predominantly conﬁned
within the region y∗ ≤ 70, although its magnitude is small. The residual component
⟨v2
R⟩1/2 is the major contributor to the wall-normal ﬂuctuations across the channel height.
The dominance of ⟨v2
R⟩1/2 has important implications for control strategies in drag
reduction, which are investigated in § 3.3. A similar observation is made for ⟨w2⟩1/2,w i t h
⟨w2
I ⟩1/2 being negligible except close to the wall for y∗ < 40.
The statistical coherence of the informative and residual velocities in the wall-parallel
plane is quantiﬁed with the two-point autocorrelation
Cφφ(/Delta1x,/Delta1z; yref ) = ⟨φ(x, yref , z, t)φ( x + /Delta1x, yref , z + /Delta1z, t)⟩
⟨φ(x, yref , z, t)2⟩ , (3.6)
where φ is any component of the velocity ﬁeld, and y∗
ref = 15. The autocorrelations are
shown in ﬁgure 5 for the total, informative and residual components of the three velocities.
The shape of the informative structure is elongated along the streamwise direction for
the three correlations CuI uI , CvIvI and CwI wI . The results for u, shown in ﬁgure 5 (a),
reveal that uI closely resembles the streaky structures of u in terms of streamwise and
spanwise lengths. On the other hand, uR consists of more compact and isotropic eddies in
the (x, z)-plane. Figure 5 (b)s h o w st h a tvI captures the elongated motions in v, which
represents a small fraction of its total energy, whereas the shorter motions in v are
contained in vR. A similar conclusion is drawn for w, as shown in ﬁgure 5 (c), where
both w and wR share a similar structure, differing from the elongated motions of wI .
The emerging picture from the correlations is that informative velocities tend to comprise
streamwise elongated motions, whereas the remaining residual components are shorter and
more isotropic. The differences between the
structures of v and w and their informative
counterparts are consistent with the lower intensities of vI and wI discussed in ﬁgure 4.I t
should be noted that the shape of the structures depends on the target variable ,a n dt h e y
may differ for a different target quantity. For example, wall pressure ﬂuctuations have been
linked to more isotropic structures in the streamwise direction by several authors (Schewe

1983; Johansson, Her & Haritonidis 1987; Kim, Moin & Moser 1987; Ghaemi & Scarano
2013). The aIND may provide insights in this regard, as it has been noted in the literature
that at least quadratic terms are needed to capture the interaction between the velocity and
the wall pressure (Naguib, Wark & Juckenhöfel 2001; Murray & Ukeiley 2003).
We now analyse the average coherent structure of the ﬂow in the ( y, z)-plane. It is
widely recognised in the literature that the most dynamically relevant energy-containing
structure in wall turbulence comprises a low-velocity streak accompanied by a collocated
roll (e.g. Kline et al. 1967;K i m et al. 1987; Farrell & Ioannou 2012; Lozano-Durán et al.
2012). A statistical description of this structure can be obtained by conditionally averaging
the ﬂow around low-velocity streaks. To this end, low-velocity streaks were identiﬁed by
ﬁnding local minima of u at y
∗ = 15. For each streak, a local frame of reference was
introduced with axes parallel to the original x, y and z coordinates. The origin of this local
frame of reference is at the wall, such that its y-axis is aligned with the local minimum
of u. The z-axis, denoted by /Delta1z, points towards the nearest local maximum of u. This
orientation ensures that any nearby high-speed streak is located in the region/Delta1z > 0. Then
the conditional average ﬂow was computed by averaging [ u,v, w] over a window of size
±h. The resulting conditionally averaged ﬂow in the ( y, z)-plane is shown in ﬁgure 6(a).
This process was repeated for the informative and residual velocity ﬁelds using the same
streaks identiﬁed previously for u. The conditionally averaged informative and residual
velocities are shown in ﬁgures 6(b,c), respectively.
The conditional average velocity is shown in ﬁgure 6 (a), which captures the structure
of the low-/high-velocity streak pair and the accompanying roll characteristic of
wall-bounded turbulence. The informative velocity ( ﬁgure 6 b) is dominated by streak
motions, although these are smaller than the streaks of the entire ﬁeld. The informative
wall-normal velocity is present mostly within the streaks, while the informative spanwise

component is active close to the wall in the interface of the streak. Conversely, ﬁgure 6(c)
shows that the residual velocity contains the large-scale streaks and the remaining
spanwise motions. The emerging picture is that the informative component of the velocity
contributing to the wall shear stress consists of smaller near-wall streaks collocated with
vertical motions (i.e.
sweeps and ejections), and spanwise velocity at the near-wall root of
the roll. This informative structure is embedded within a larger-scale streak–roll structure
of residual velocity, which bears no information about the wall shear stress.
We close this subsection by analysing the mappings τx,+ = Fu(uI), τx,+ =
Fv(vI), τx,+ = Fw(wI) obtained from the constraints H(τx,+ | uI) = 0, H(τx,+ |vI) = 0,
H(τx,+ | wI) = 0, respectively. The mapping are depicted in ﬁgure 7 at the wall-normal
position where the energy for uI , vI and wI is maximum, namely, y∗ ≈ 8, 19 and 6,
respectively (see Appendix D). Figure 7(a) reveals an almost linear relationship between
uI and τx,+ within the range 0 ≤ τ∗
x,+ ≤ 2. Negative values of uI align with τ∗
x,+ < 1,
while positive values of uI correspond to τ∗
x,+ > 1. This is clearly a manifestation of
the proportionality between streak intensity and τx, such that higher streamwise velocities
translate into higher wall shear stress by increasing∂U/∂y. However, the process saturates,
and a noticeable change in the slope occurs for larger values of τx,+, leading to uI values
that are relatively independent of τx,+. This ﬁnding indicates that uI provides limited
information about high values of τx,+ at the time scale /Delta1T∗ = 25. In other words, minor
uncertainties in uI result in signiﬁcant uncertainties in τx,+ after /Delta1T.
The effect of /Delta1T on Fu(uI) is also analysed in ﬁgure 7(a). The main effect of decreasing
/Delta1T∗ is to decrease the slope of Fu(uI) for u∗
I > 5. This result reveals that there exists a
time horizon beyond which it is not possible to predict extreme events of wall shear stress
from local ﬂuctuations. Hence extreme values of the wall shear stress can be attributed
to almost instantaneous high ﬂuctuations of the streamwise velocity. The latter is in
agreement with Guerrero, Lambert & Chin ( 2020), who linked extreme positive wall
shear stresses with the presence of high-momentum regions created by quasi-streamwise
vortices.
The mapping of v
I is shown in ﬁgure 7 (b), which demonstrates again a nearly linear,
albeit negative, relationship betweenvI and τx,+ in the range 0 ≤ τ∗
x,+ ≤ 2. Positive values
of vI are indicative ofτ∗
x,+ < 1, whereas negative values implyτ∗
x,+ > 1. Note that changes
in the value of τx,+ encompass either uI > 0a n dvI < 0,o r uI < 0a n dvI > 0, revealing a
connection between the dynamics of τx,+ and the well-known sweep and ejection motions
in wall-bounded turbulence (Wallace, Eckelman & Brodkey 1972; Wallace 2016). The

mappings also show that excursions into large wall shear stresses are caused by sweeps.
Analogous to uI ,t h ev a l u eo fvI remains approximately constant for τ∗
x,+ > 2. Beyond that
threshold, vI provides no information about τx,+.
The mapping of wI presents two maxima (±/Delta1zmax
w ) due to the spanwise symmetry of the
ﬂow. The results for each maximum, shown in ﬁgure 7(c), are antisymmetric with respect
to wI . Similarly to uI and vI , there is an almost linear relationship between wI and τx,+
in the range 0 ≤ τ∗
x,+ ≤ 2. For +/Delta1zmax
w , negative values of wI indicate τ∗
x,+ < 1, whereas
positive values are linked to τ∗
x,+ > 1. The opposite is true for −/Delta1zmax
w .L o wv a l u e so f
τx,+ are connected to low uI , and positive (negative) values of wI for +/Delta1zmax
w (−/Delta1zmax
w ).
This outcome is consistent with the conditional average ﬂow from ﬁgure 6, where it was
shown that the information transfer between wI and τx,+ is mediated through the bottom
part of the roll structure that accompanies high-/low-velocity streaks. The saturation of the
inﬂuence of wI to intense values of the wall shear stress is again observed for τ∗
x,+ ≳ 2.
The information provided by the mappings can be embedded into the instantaneous
coherent structures. In ﬁgure 3 (b), the uI(x, t) structures are coloured by the local value
of ∂F/∂uI . This metric serves as a measure of the uncertainty in the wall shear stress as
a function of uI .L o wv a l u e so f∂F/∂uI are associated with low uncertainty in τx,+. This
implies that small changes in uI result in small changes in τx,+. On the other hand, high
values of ∂F/∂uI are associated with high uncertainty in τx,+, such that small variations
in uI result in large changes in τx,+. Interestingly, ﬁgure 3(b) shows that low-speed streaks
– associated with ejections – are connected to low uncertainty values for τx along their
entire wall-normal extent. On the contrary, the high-speed streaks of uI , linked to extreme
events, carry increasing uncertainty in τx (indicated by the light yellow colour) as they
move further away from the wall.
3.2. Reduced-order modelling: reconstruction of the wall shear stress from u
We evaluate the predictive capabilities of the informative and residual components of
the streamwise velocity ﬂuctuations to reconstruct the wall shear stress in the future.
The main aim of this subsection is to illustrate that when u is used as the input for
developing a model, the resulting model exclusively utilises information from uI , while
uR is disregarded.

T wo scenarios are considered. In the ﬁrst case, we devise a model for the pointwise,
temporal forecasting of τx,+ using pointwise data of u. In the second scenario, the spatially
two-dimensional wall shear stress is reconstructed using u data from a wall-parallel plane
located at given distance from the wall.
First, we discuss the pointwise forecasting of τx,+ using pointwise data of u.W e
aim to predict the future of the wall shear stress at one point at the wall, τx,+ =
τx(x0, z0, t + /Delta1T), where x0 and z0 are ﬁxed, and the time lag is /Delta1T∗ = 25. Three
models are considered , using as input u(x0, t), uI(x0, t) and uR(x0, t), respectively, where
x0 = [x0 + /Delta1xmax
u , yref , z0]a n d y∗
ref ≈ 10. The data are extracted from a simulation with
the same set-up and friction Reynolds number as in § 3.1 but in a smaller computational
domain (πh × 2h × π/2h). Note that all the points [ x0, z0] are statistically equivalent and
can be used to train the model.
As a preliminary step to developing the forecasting models, we use a feedforward
artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) to separate u into uI and uR without need of τx,+. This
step is required to make the models predictive, as in a practical case, the future of τx is
unknown and cannot be used to obtained the informative and residual components. The
model is given by
[˜u
I(x0, t), ˜uR(x0, t)] = ANNI,R(u(x0, t), u(x0, t − δt) ,..., u(x0, t − pδt)), (3.7)
where the tilde in ˜uI and ˜uR denotes estimated quantities, δt∗ = 0.5,a n d p = 1000 is
the number of time lags considered. Multiple time lags are required for predicting ˜uI
and ˜uR, in the same manner as time series of u and τx,+ were used to compute uI . The
function ANNI,R comprises 6 hidden layers with 50 neurons per layer and ReLU activation
functions. The approximately 700 000 samples are divided into 80 % for training and 20 %
for validation. The Adam algorithm (Kingma & Ba 2017) is used to ﬁnd the optimum
solution. An example of the approximate decomposition from ( 3.7) is shown in ﬁgure 8.
The three ANN models trained to forecast τx,+ are

Note that ( 3.8a)a n d( 3.8b) use only one time step of ˜uI and ˜uR, respectively, while (3.8c)
incorporates multiple time lags of u. This approach is chosen because (3.7) (used to predict
˜uI and ˜uR) also depends on multiple time lags of u. By training ( 3.8c) using the same time
lags as (3.7), the predictions for ˜τU
x rely on a model that accesses an equivalent amount of
information about past states of the ﬂow as do the models for predicting ˜τI
x and ˜τR
x . This
ensures a fair comparison among models.
The forecasting of the wall shear stress by the three models is illustrated in ﬁgure 9. The
results indicate that the predictions based on u and ˜uI are comparable, with relative mean
squared errors 18 % and 22 %, respectively. The marginally larger error from the model
using ˜uI as input arises from inaccuracies within the ANN responsible for decomposing
u into ˜uI and ˜uR. In a perfect scenario, the forecasting errors using either u or ˜uI as input
would be identical, implying that ˜uI contains all the information in u to make predictions.
In contrast, the model that utilises the residual component ˜uR fails to accurately predict the
wall shear stress ( approximately by 100 % error), yielding values that are nearly constant
and close to the time average of ˜τx. These ﬁndings demonstrate that when u is used as
input, the model extracts predictive information from ˜uI , while ˜uR provides no predictive
value.
It is important to clarify that we are not advocating for the separation of inputs into
informative and residual components as a standard practice for training models. Instead,
our goal is to illustrate that the training process of a model implicitly discriminates

between these components, supporting our claim that all the necessary information for
reduced-order modelling is encapsulated in uI . An interesting consequence of this property
is that the characteristics and structure of uR are not useful for understanding the predictive
capabilities of the model; instead, they help to discern which factors are irrelevant. For
further discussion on the role of information in predictive modelling, the reader is referred
to Lozano-Durán & Arranz ( 2022) and Yuan & Lozano-Durán ( 2024).

[˜uI(xref , t), ˜uR(xref , t)] = CNNI,R(u(xref , t), u(xref , t − δt) ,..., u(xref , t − pδt)), (3.9)
where p = 500 and δt∗ = 0.5. The CNN is designed to process input data shaped as
three-dimensional arrays, where dimensions represent spatial coordinates and temporal
slices. The CNN comprises an image input layer, followed by three blocks consisting each
of a convolutional layer, batch normalisation, and a ReLU activation function. Spatial
dimensions are reduced through successive max pooling layers, while feature maps are
subsequently upscaled back to original dimensions via transposed convolutional layers
with ReLU activations. Further details of the CNN are provided in ﬁgure 10.At o t a lo f
12 000 snapshots are used, split into training (80 %) and validation (20 %). An example of
the approximate decomposition from ( 3.9) is shown in ﬁgure 11.

using the CNN from ( 3.9) without need of τx,+:( a) uI ,( b) ˜uI ,( c) uR,a n d(d) ˜uR.
Similarly to the previous case, the ﬁrst two models use only one time step for ˜uI and
˜uR, respectively, whereas the last model uses multiple time lags for u (with p = 500 and
δt∗ = 0.5).
The spatial reconstruction of the wall shear stress by the three models is shown in
ﬁgure 12 for one instant. Consistently with our previous observations, the reconstructions
using u and ˜uI as inputs to the model are comparable in both structure and magnitude,
yielding relative mean squared errors 28 % and 30 %, respectively. Conversely, the CNN
that utilises the residual component ˜uR is completely unable to predict the two-dimensional
structure of the wall shear stress, yielding average relative error of 120 %. These results
further reinforce the idea that models rely on the informative component of the input to
predict the output variable, whereas the residual component is of no utility. Finally, it
is worth noting that the CNNs used above have access to the two-dimensional spatial
structure of u and τx; however, the aIND method, which was originally used to decompose
the ﬂow, used only pointwise information. This , along with the inability of ˜uR to predict
the wall shear stress , further conﬁrms that the assumptions of the aIND method hold
reasonably well in this case.
3.3. Control: wall shear stress reduction with opposition control
We investigate the application of the IND to opposition control in a turbulent channel
ﬂow (Choi, Moin & Kim 1994; Hammond, Bewley & Moin 1998). Opposition control is
a drag reduction technique based on blowing and sucking ﬂuid at the wall with a velocity
opposed to the velocity measured at some distance from the wall. The hypothesis under
consideration in this subsection is that the informative component of the wall-normal
velocity is more impactful for controlling the ﬂow compared to the residual component.
The rationale behind this hypothesis is grounded in the information-theoretic formulation
of observability introduced by Lozano-Durán & Arranz ( 2022). This formulation deﬁnes

the observability of a variable ( τx,+) in terms of the knowledge gained from another
variable (v) as
Ov→ τx,+ = I(τx,+;v)
H(τx,+) . (3.11)
The variable τx,+ is said to be perfectly observable with respect to v when Ov→ τx,+ = 1,
i.e. there is no uncertainty in the state to be controlled conditioned to knowing the
state of the sensor. Conversely, τx,+ is completely unobservable when Ou→ τx,+ = 0,
i.e. the sensor does not have access to any information about τx,+. The greater the
observability, the more information is available for controlling the system. By substituting
(2.5)a n d( 2.7)i n t o(3.11), it is easy to show that τx,+ is unobservable with respect to the
residual component ( OvR→ τx,+ = 0), and perfectly observable from the perspective of the
informative component (OvI→ τx,+ = 1).
Figure 13 shows a schematic of the problem set-up for opposition control in a turbulent
channel ﬂow. The channel is as in § 3.2, but the wall-normal velocity at the wall is replaced
by v(x, 0, z, t) = f(v(x, ys, z, t)), where ys is the distance to the sensing plane, and f is a
user-deﬁned function. In the original formulation by Choi et al. (1994), f ≡− v(x, ys, z, t),
hence the name opposition control. Here, we set y∗
s ≈ 14, which is the optimum wall
distance reported in previous works (Chung & Talha2011; Lozano-Durán & Arranz 2022).
T wo Reynolds numbers are considered,Reτ = 180 and 395.
We split v(x, ys, z, t) into its informative ( vI ) and residual ( vR) components to
τx(x, z, t). Three controllers are investigated. In the ﬁrst case, the function of the
controller f is such that it uses only the informative component of v(x, ys, z, t), namely
f(v(x, ys, z, t)) ≡− vI(x, ys, z, t). In the second case, the controller uses the residual
component f(v(x, ys, z, t)) ≡− vR(x, ys, z, t). Finally, the third controller follows the
original formulation f(v(x, ys, z, t)) ≡− v(x, ys, z, t).

∗ =− 1.8t or e df o rv∗ = 1.8.
This is a more challenging application of the IND due to the dynamic nature of the
control problem. When the ﬂow is actuated, the dynamics of the system changes, and
the controller should re-compute vI (or vR) for the newly actuated ﬂow. This problem is
computationally expensive, and we resort to calculating an approximation. The control
strategy is implemented as follows.
(i) A simulation is performed with f ≡− v(x, ys, z, t), corresponding to the original
version of opposition control.
(ii) The informative term ( vI )o f v(x, ys, z, t) related to the wall shear stress τx(x, z, t) is
extracted for /Delta1T = 0.
(iii) We ﬁnd an approximation of the controller, such that ˜vI = f(v) ≈− vI . To obtain
this approximation, we solve the minimisation problem
arg min
˜vI
∥vI −˜vI∥2 + γ I(τx;˜vR)
H(τx) , (3.12)
where γ = 0.75. The approximated informative term is modelled as a feedforward
ANN with 3 layers and 8 neurons per layer.
(iv) T wo new simulations are conducted , using either ˜vI or ˜vR = v −˜vI for opposition
control.
Note that the devised controller can be applied in real time (i.e. during simulation runtime),
since the estimated information component ˜vI(t) is computed using only information from
the present time instant, v(t).
Figure 14 summarises the drag reduction for the three scenarios, namely f ≡
−v(x, ys, z, t), f ≡−˜ vI(x, ys, z, t) and f ≡−˜ vR(x, ys, z, t). The original opposition control
achieves drag reductions approximately 22 % and 24 % for Reτ = 180 and Reτ = 395,
respectively. Similar reductions in drag using the same controller have been documented
in the literature (Chung & Talha 2011; Luhar, Sharma & McKeon 2014). The values show
a marginal dependency on Re
τ, in agreement with previous studies (Iwamoto, Suzuki &
Kasagi 2002). Opposition control based on ˜vI yields a moderate increase in drag reduction
with a 24 % and 26 % drop for each Reτ, respectively. Conversely, the drag reduction is
only up to 7 % for the control based on the estimated residual velocity, ˜vR.N o t et h a tvI
is the component of v with the highest potential to modify the drag. Whether the drag
increases or decreases depends on the speciﬁcs of the controller. On the other hand, the
residual component vR is expected to have a minor impact on the drag. As such, one
might anticipate a 0 % drag reduction by using vR. However, the approximation ˜vR retains

some information from the original velocity for intense values of the latter, which seems
to reduce the drag on some occasions. Simulations using f ≡− k˜vR – with k adjusted
to f ∼∥ v(x, ys, z, t)∥2 – were also conducted, yielding no additional improvements in
the drag reduction beyond 8 %. It is also interesting to note that after performing steps
(i)–(iv) of the control strategy, the informative content in v increases substantially (from
Ev
I ≈ 0.1t o Ev
I ≈ 0.8). This phenomenon exposes the dynamic nature of the control
problem highlighted above.
Figures 15(a,c) show the wall-normal velocity in the sensing plane for the controlled
cases at Reτ = 180 with f ≡−˜ vI and f ≡−˜ vR, respectively. Larger velocity amplitudes
are observed in ﬁgure 15 (c) compared to ﬁgure 15 (a), indicating that higher Reynolds
stresses are expected, which aligns with a larger average wall shear stress. On the other
hand, ﬁgures 15(b,d) display the negative wall-normal velocity imposed at the boundary
for the cases with f ≡−˜ vI and f ≡−˜ vR, respectively. The informative component ˜vI
closely resembles the original velocity but with smaller amplitudes at extreme events of v.
This appears to play a slightly beneﬁcial role in drag reduction. Conversely, ﬁgure 15(d)
shows that the estimated residual component is negligible except for large values ofv. This
is responsible for the smaller reduction in the mean drag. Although not shown, similar ﬂow
structures are observed for Reτ = 395, and the same discussion applies. In summary, we
have utilised an example of opposition control in a turbulent channel to demonstrate the
utility of IND. However, it is important to emphasise that the primary focus of this section
is not on the real-time applicability or the performance of the control in this speciﬁc case.
Instead, the main message
that we aim to convey is more fundamental: the informative
component of the variable measured by the sensor holds the essential information needed
to develop successful control strategies, while the residual component is not useful in this
regard.
4. Conclusions
We have presented informative and non-informative decomposition (IND), a method for
decomposing a ﬂow ﬁeld into its informative and residual components relative to a target
ﬁeld. The informative ﬁeld contains all the information necessary to explain the target
variable, contrasting with the residual component,
which holds no relevance to the target
variable. The decomposition of the source ﬁeld is formulated as an optimisation problem
based on mutual information. To alleviate the computational cost and data requirements

of IND, we have introduced an approximate solution, referred to as aIND. This approach
still ensures that the informative component retains the information about the target, by
minimising the mutual information between the residual and the target in a pointwise
manner.
The IND is grounded in the fundamental principles of information theory, offering key
advantages over other methods. As such, it is invariant under shifting, rescaling, and, in
general, nonlinear C1-diffeomorphism transformations of the source and target variables
(Kaiser & Schreiber 2002). The method is also fully nonlinear, and does not rely on
simpliﬁcations such as the Gaussianity of the variables. This makes IND a suitable tool for
studying turbulent phenomena, which are intrinsically nonlinear. In contrast, other linear
correlation-based methods, such as LSE and EPOD, are not well equipped to capture
nonlinearities in the ﬂows. Additionally, we have shown that the pointwise formulation
of the method (aIND) represents a cost-effective and memory-efﬁcient implementation
of IND without sacriﬁcing performance compared to correlation-based methods. This
approach also allows for the assimilation of experimental data.
The method has been applied to study the information content of the velocity
ﬂuctuations in relation to the wall shear stress in a turbulent channel ﬂow at Reτ =
180. Our ﬁndings have revealed that streamwise ﬂuctuations contain more information
about the future wall shear stress than the cross-ﬂow velocities. The energy of the
informative streamwise velocity peaks at y∗ ≈ 10, slightly below the well-known peak
for total velocity, while the residual component peaks at y∗ ≈ 30. This suggests that
the peak observed in the total velocity ﬂuctuations results from both active and
inactive velocities, with ‘active’ referring to motions connected to changes in the wall
shear stress. Further investigation of the coherent structure of the ﬂow showed that
the informative velocity consists of smaller near-wall high- and low-velocity streaks
collocated with vertical motions (i.e.
sweeps and ejections). The spanwise informative
1000 A95-22

IND of turbulent ﬂow ﬁelds
velocity is weak, except close to the wall within the bottom root of the streamwise
rolls. This informative streak–roll structure is embedded within a larger-scale streak–roll
structure from the residual velocity, which bears no information about the wall shear
stress for the considered time scale. We have also shown that ejections propagate
information about the wall stress further from the wall than sweeps, while extreme
values of the wall shear stress are attributed to sweeps in close proximity to the
wall.
The utility of IND for reduced-order modelling was demonstrated in the prediction
of the wall shear stress in a turbulent channel ﬂow. The objective was to estimate
the
two-dimensional wall shear stress in the future, after /Delta1T∗ = 25, by measuring the
streamwise velocity in a wall-parallel plane at y∗ ≈ 10 as input. The approach was
implemented using a fully convolutional neural network as the predictor. T wo cases
were considered, using either the informative or the residual velocity component as
input, respectively. The main discrepancies were localised in regions with high wall
shear stress values. This outcome aligns with our prior analysis, which indicated that
extreme
wall shear stress events are produced by short-time near-wall sweeps not
captured in the input plane. In contrast, the residual velocity component offers no
predictive power for wall shear stress, as it has no observability of the wall shear
stress, meaning that it lacks any information relevant to the latter. This example in
reduced-order modelling reveals that models achieving the highest performance are
those that utilise input variables with the maximum amount of information about the
output.
Finally, we have investigated the application of IND for drag reduction in turbulent
channel ﬂows at Re
τ = 180 and 395. The strategy implemented involved blowing/suction
via opposition control. To this end, the no-transpiration boundary condition at the wall
was replaced with the wall-normal velocity measured in the wall-parallel plane at y∗ = 14.
We explored the use of three wall-normal velocities: the total velocity (i.e. as originally
formulated in opposition control), its informative component, and its residual component.
The largest reduction in drag was achieved using the informative component of v, which
performed slightly better than the total velocity for both Reynolds numbers. The residual
component was shown to yield the poorest results. The application to drag reduction
demonstrated here illustrates that the informative component of v contains the essential
information needed for effective ﬂow control. This paves the way for using IND to devise
enhanced control strategies by isolating the relevant information from the input variables
while disregarding the irrelevant contributions.
We conclude this work by highlighting the potential of IND as a post-processing tool
for gaining physical insight into the interactions among variables in turbulent ﬂows.
Nonetheless, it is also worth noting that the approach relies on the mutual information
between variables, which requires estimating joint probability density functions. This
entails a data-intensive process that could become a constraint in cases where the amount
of numerical or experimental data available is limited. Future efforts will be devoted
to reducing the data requirements of aIND and extending its capabilities to account for
multi-variable and
multi-scale interactions among variables.

Appendix A. Numerical implementation
A.1. Solution for scalar variables using bijective functions
Here, we provide the methodology to tackle the minimisation problem posed in ( 2.10). For
convenience, we write (2.10)a g a i n:
arg min
ΦI,F
I(ΦR;ΦI) + γ∥Φ − ΦI∥2, s.t.Ψ + = F(ΦI). (A1)
To solve (A1), we note that there are two unknowns: ΦI and the function F. If we assume
that F is invertible, namely
ΦI(t) = F− 1(Ψ+(t)) ≡ B(Ψ+(t)), (A2)
then (A1) can be recast as
arg min
B
I(Φ − B(q+); B(q+)) + γ∥Φ − B(Ψ+)∥2, (A3)
which can be solved by standard optimisation techniques upon the parametrisation of the
function B.
However, by imposing bijectivity, we constrain the feasible ΦI(t) solutions that satisfy
H(Ψ+ | ΦI) = 0 and could lead to lower values of the loss function than in the more lenient
case, where F needs only to be surjective. To circumvent this limitation, we recall that a
surjective function with N − 1 local extrema points (points where the slope changes sign)
can be split into N bijective functions (see ﬁgure 16a). In particular, we deﬁne
ΦI(t) = Bi(Ψ+(t)) s.t.Φ (t) ∈ [ri− 1, ri), (A4)
where ri is the ith local extremum, such that ri > ri− 1, r0 →− ∞ and rN →∞ .
Therefore, the ﬁnal form of the minimisation equation is

The functions plotted within boxes are the activation functions acting on the neurons. Adapted from Huang
et al. (2018).
We use feedforward networks to ﬁnd Bi, as they are able to approximate any
Borel-measurable function on a compact domain (Hornik, Stinchcombe & White 1989).
In particular, we use the deep sigmoidal ﬂow (DSF) proposed by Huang et al. (2018), who
proved that a feedforward ANN is a bijective transformation if the activation functions
are bijective and all the weights are positive. The details of the DSF architecture and the
optimisation can be found in
§ A.2.
One must emphasise that the current minimisation problem posed in ( 2.10) differs from
the classical ﬂow reconstruction problem (e.g. Erichson et al. 2020) where the maximum
reconstruction of Φ is sought. In those cases, we look for a function G(Ψ+) that minimises
∥Φ − G(Ψ+)∥2. If the result is a non-bijective function, then the constraint H(Ψ+ |ΦI) =
0 will not be satisﬁed.
A.2. Networks architecture and optimisation details
The present algorithm uses DSF networks to approximate bijective functions. This network
architecture is depicted in ﬁgure 16 (b). The DSF is composed of L stacked sigmoidal
transformations. Each transformation produces the output,
xl = σ− 1(wT
l × σ(al × xl− 1 + bl)), l = 1,..., L, (A8)
where xl− 1 is the input, σ( y) = 1/(1 + e− y) is the logistic function, σ− 1 is the inverse
of σ, al and bl are vectors with the weights and biases of the decoder part of the l-layer,
and wl is a vector with the weights of the encoder part of the l-layer (see ﬁgure 16b). In
addition, the weights for each layer have to fulﬁl 0 < wl,i < 1, ∑
i wl,i = 1 and al,i > 0,
i = 1,..., M, where M is the number of neurons per layer. These constraints are enforced
via the softmax and exponential activation functions for wl and al, respectively, namely
wl,i =
exp(w′
l,i)
N∑
i=1
exp(w′
l,i)
, al,i = exp(a′
l,i). (A9a,b)
More details on the DSF architecture can be found in Huang et al. (2018).
To compute the optimal weights and biases that yield the optimal Bi that minimise (A5),
we use the Adam algorithm (Kingma & Ba 2017). This minimisation process requires all

operations to be continuous and differentiable. To achieve that, we compute the mutual
information using a kernel density estimator , and the piecewise-deﬁned functions B0
i are
made C1 continuous by applying the logistic function
B0
i (Ψ+;Φ) = Bi(Ψ+)σ( k(Φ −˜ri− 1)) σ(k(˜ri − Φ)), (A10)
where the parameter k > 0 can be chosen to control the steepness of the function, and
˜rj = rj ± log(p/( p − 1))/k, which ensures B0
i = pBi at the boundaries.
In the present study, the ﬁrst term in ( 2.10) is normalised with ∥Φ ∥2, and the second
term is normalised with H(ΦI,Φ R)/2. Under this normalisation, free parameters p = 0.99
and k = 500 were determined to be adequate for the optimisation process. The number
of bijective functions N was selected to minimise ( A5) while producing a continuous
mapping, as illustrated in ﬁgures 2 and 16(a). In the study presented in § 3,a n N value of 1
was found to be optimal. We also explored different values for the regularisation constant
γ.F o rN = 1, similar mappings were achieved for 0 .5 ≥ γ ≥ 2, and the results discussed
in § 3 were calculated with γ = 1. In cases with N ≥ 1, starting with a high γ value,
approximately 10, during initial iterations proved beneﬁcial for converging the solution.
Subsequently, γ was gradually decreased to emphasise the minimisation of the ﬁrst term
in ( A5). Currently, this adjustment is performed manually, but future developments in
aIND could automate this process (Groenendijk et al. 2021). Finally, the DSF architecture
was set to 3 layers with 12 neurons per layer.
Appendix B. Validation of aIND and comparison with EPOD and LSE
We include two additional validation cases of aIND applied to two-dimensional ﬁelds in a
plane x = (x, z). These synthetic examples have an exact analytic solution that enables us
to quantify the error produced by the different methods. We consider the system
source Φ( x, t) = ΦI(x, t) + ΦR(x, t), (B1)
target Ψ+(x, t) = F(ΦI(x, t)), (B2)
where the ﬁelds ΦI and ΦR and the function F are given. In particular, ΦI and ΦR
are the velocity ﬂuctuations in the planes y∗ ≈ 5 and 40, respectively, of a turbulent
channel ﬂow with Reτ = 180 in a domain 8πh × 2h × 4πh in the streamwise, wall-normal
and spanwise directions, respectively. Instantaneous snapshots of the ﬁelds are shown in
ﬁgure 17. To ensure that the ﬁelds are independent (i.e. I(ΦI,Φ R) = 0), the informative
ﬁeld is extracted at y∗ ≈ 5 from the bottom wall, whereas the residual ﬁeld is extracted at
y∗ ≈ 40 from the top wall at a shifted time step.
We compare aIND with the extended POD method (EPOD) proposed by Borée ( 2003)
and the spectral in space version of the LSE presented by Encinar & Jiménez ( 2019). In
the following subsections, we provide a small overview of each method.
B.1. Extended POD
The EPOD offers a linear decomposition of a source ﬁeld Φ( x, t) into its correlated ( C)
and decorrelated ( D) contributions to a given target ﬁeld such that
ΦC(x, t) =
∑
n
an
Ψ (t) Un
Φ (x), (B3)
ΦD(x, t) = Φ( x, t) − ΦC(x, t), (B4)

where n is the number of modes, and an
Ψ is the temporal coefﬁcient of the nth POD mode
of the target ﬁeld Ψ+ and Un
Φ in the nth spatial mode. The latter is computed as
Un
Φ (x) = ⟨an
Ψ Φ( x, t)⟩t
⟨an
Ψ an
Ψ
⟩ , (B5)
where ⟨·⟩t denotes temporal average. The EPOD decomposition has the following
properties (Borée 2003).
(i) The correlation between the original source ﬁeld and the target ﬁeld is the same as
the correlation between the correlated ﬁeld and the target ﬁeld, namely
⟨ΦΨ ⟩=⟨ ΦCΨ ⟩. (B6)
(ii) The decorrelated ﬁeld is uncorrelated with the target ﬁeld, i.e.
⟨ΦDΨ ⟩= 0. (B7)
Therefore, we deﬁne the EPOD informative component as the correlated ﬁeld
(Φ EPOD
I ≡ ΦC)a n d the EPOD residual component as the decorrelated ﬁeld ( Φ EPOD
R ≡
ΦD). In the following examples, the POD of the target ﬁeld is obtained using 300 snapshots
and the informative ﬁeld is reconstructed using the 50 more energetic modes.
B.2. Spectral LSE
The LSE, proposed by Adrian & Moin ( 1988), provides the best mean square linear
estimate of the ‘response’ ﬁeld Φ( x, t) given the ‘predictor’ Ψ+(x, t) (Tinney et al. 2006).
Considering a collection of discrete spatial locations xi, the best linear estimate that
minimises
arg min
˜Φ
⟨(Φ( xi, t) − ˜Φ( xi, t))2⟩t (B8)
is given by
˜Φ( xi, t) = Lij Ψ+(xj, t), (B9)
where repeated indices imply summation. The entries of the matrix L take the form (Adrian
&M o i n1988)
Lij(xm) = ⟨Φ( xi, t)Ψ( xm, t)⟩t
⟨Ψ( xj, t)Ψ( xm, t)⟩t
. (B10)
1000 A95-27
https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2024.1007
 Published online by Cambridge University Press
G. Arranz and A. Lozano-Durán
From ( B8), we deﬁne the LSE informative and residual components as Φ LSE
I (x, t) ≡
˜Φ( x, t) and Φ LSE
R (x, t) ≡ Φ − ˜Φ( x, t), respectively.
In the following examples, we exploit the spatial periodicity of the ﬂow ﬁeld. To that
end, we adopt the approach by Encinar & Jiménez ( 2019) and use a spatial Fourier basis to
project the ﬁelds. This procedure is usually known as spectral linear stochastic estimation
(SLSE). Equation (B10)
becomes
ˆL(kx, kz) = ⟨ ˆΨ( kx, kz, t) ˆΦ †(kx, kz, t)⟩t
⟨ ˆΦ( kx, kz, t) ˆΦ ∗(kx, kz, t)⟩t
, (B11)
where ˆ(·) denotes the Fourier transform, (·)† is the complex conjugate, and kx, kz are the
wavenumbers in the x, z directions, respectively. It can be shown ( see Tinney et al. 2006;
Encinar & Jiménez 2019)t h a tthe optimal estimator is
ΦI(xi, t) =
∑
j
L(xi − xj, zi − zj)Ψ( xj, zj, t). (B12)
B.3. Linear mapping
As a ﬁrst validation case, we consider a linear mapping function
source Φ( x, t) = ΦI(x, t) + ΦR(x, t), (B13a)
target Ψ+(x, t) = ΦI(x, t). (B13b)
The exact informative and residual ﬁelds are normalised such that their standard deviations
are ⟨ΦIΦI⟩= 1 and ⟨ΦRΦR⟩= 1, respectively. The instantaneous reconstructed ﬁelds are
displayed in ﬁgure 18. To ease the comparison, the time instant is the same as in ﬁgure 17.
We can observe that aIND accurately reconstructs the informative and residual ﬁelds.
The SLSE is also able to reconstruct the mapping, which is expected since the mapping is
linear. On the contrary, EPOD fails to obtain the correct informative/residual ﬁeld despite
the linear character of the decomposition. Instead, it tends to reconstruct the original
ﬁeld Φ .
B.4. Nonlinear mapping
As a second validation case, we consider the nonlinear mapping function
source Φ( x, t) = ΦI(x, t) + ΦR(x, t), (B14a)
target Ψ+(x, t) = Φ 2
I (x, t) − 0.2ΦI(x, t). (B14b)
The exact informative and residual ﬁelds are normalised such that their standard
deviations are ⟨ΦIΦI⟩= 1 and ⟨ΦRΦR⟩= 0.2, respectively. The instantaneous
reconstructed ﬁelds are displayed in ﬁgure 19 at the same time instant as in ﬁgure 17.
In this case, SLSE fails to correctly split the ﬂow into the informative and residual ﬁelds.
The same applies to EPOD: although the reconstruction of the informative resembles the
original (due to higher correlation between the original and the informative terms
from
(B14a)), the error ΦI − Φ EPOD
I is signiﬁcant everywhere. A similar error is observed for
the residual ﬁeld, which is not correctly identiﬁed by EPOD. The aIND, similar to the

discrepancies in ΦI − Φ IND
I occur at the locations where ΦI ≈ 0, and stem from the
approach followed to computeΦ IND
I . Note that aIND accurately reconstructs the analytical
mapping as shown in ﬁgure 20.
Appendix C. Analytical solution for Gaussian distributions
For the special case in which all the components in Φ I, Ψ + are jointly normal distributed
variables, we can write their mutual information as (Cover & Thomas 2006)
I(Ψ +; Φ I) = 1
2 log
(|Σ( Φ I)|| Σ( Ψ +)|
|Σ( Ψ +⊕ Φ I)|
)
. (C1)
In ( C1), |·| denotes the matrix determinant, Σ( Φ I) is the covariance matrix of Φ I (and
similarly for Ψ +), a square matrix whose i, j entry is deﬁned as
Σ( Φ I)[i, j] =⟨ ΦI,i(t)Φ I,j(t)⟩t, (C2)

IND of turbulent ﬂow ﬁelds
where ΦI,i is the ith element of Φ I . The covariance matrix Σ( Ψ + ⊕ Φ I) can be written
in block matrix form as
Σ( Ψ +⊕ Φ I) =
[ Σ( Ψ +)Σ ( Ψ +, Φ I)
Σ( Ψ +, Φ I)T Σ( Φ I)
]
, (C3)
where Σ( Ψ +, Φ I) is the cross-covariance matrix
Σ( Ψ +, Φ I)[i, j] =⟨ Ψ+,i(t)Φ I,j(t)⟩t. (C4)
The mutual information in ( C1)i s maximised when |Σ( Ψ + ⊕ Φ I)|= 0, provided
that |Σ( Φ I)| /= 0. Using the block determinant identity (Johnson & Horn 1985; Barnett,
Barrett & Seth 2009) gives
|Σ( Ψ +⊕ Φ I)|=| Σ( Ψ +)|| Σ( Φ I) − Σ( Ψ +, Φ I)Σ( Ψ +)− 1 Σ( Ψ +, Φ I)T| (C5a)
=| Σ( Φ I+)|| Σ( Ψ +) − Σ( Ψ +, Φ I)T Σ( Φ I)− 1 Σ( Ψ +, Φ I)|. (C5b)
The second term in ( C5a) (resp. ( C5b)) is the residual of a linear regression of Ψ + on
Φ I (resp. Φ I on Ψ +) (Barnett et al. 2009). Therefore, the mutual information in ( C1)i s
maximised when Φ I is a linear function of Ψ +,o r vice versa. However, only when Ψ + is
a function of Φ I , H(Ψ +|Φ I) = 0, as required by ( 2.5).
We assume that the number NΦ of elements in Φ is larger than the number NΨ of
elements of Ψ +, so that if we ﬁnd
Φ I = LΨ +, (C6)
then we can ﬁnd the inverse mapping
Ψ + = L− 1Φ I. (C7)
The mutual information in (2.7) can be expanded as
I(Ψ +; Φ R) = 1
2 log
(|Σ( Φ R)|| Σ( Ψ +)|
|Σ( Ψ +⊕ Φ R)|
)
, (C8)
which will be equal to zero for |Σ( Ψ + ⊕ Φ R)|=| Σ( Ψ +)|| Σ( Φ R)|. From the block
determinant identity, this requires
|Σ( Ψ +, Φ R)Σ( Ψ +)− 1 Σ( Ψ +, Φ R)T|= 0. (C9)
In a general scenario , this requires
Σ( Ψ +, Φ R)[i, j] = 0, (C10)
namely
⟨Ψ+,i(Φj − L[ j, m] Ψ+,m)⟩t ≡⟨ Ψ+,iΦj⟩t −⟨ Ψ+,i L[ j, m] Ψ+,m⟩t = 0, (C11)
where Ψ+,k is the kth element of Ψ + and repeated indices imply summation. The solution
to (C11) is given by Adrian & Moin ( 1988), and it correspond to the LSE:
L[ j, m] = ⟨Ψ+,iΦj⟩t
⟨Ψ+,jΨ+,m⟩t
. (C12)
Therefore, for the special case in which all variables involved are jointly normal
distributed variables, the solution to IND is LSE. From the previous results, it is

G. Arranz and A. Lozano-Durán
straightforward to prove that the solution to aIND when Φ,Ψ + are jointly distributed is
given by
ΦI(t) = ⟨Ψ+Φ ⟩t
⟨Ψ+Ψ+⟩t
Ψ+(t). (C13)
We conclude by emphasising that the similarity between IND and higher-order versions
of LSE does not extend to the most likely case where all the variables are not jointly
normal distributed. In this scenario, higher-order versions of LSE attempt to obtain a
better reconstruction of Φ using Ψ
+, which will not fulﬁl the condition H(Ψ +|Φ I) = 0,
as discussed in the last paragraph of § A.1.
Appendix D. Computation of /Delta1xmax for the turbulent channel ﬂow
The aIND requires the value of /Delta1xmax
□ = (/Delta1xmax
□ ,/Delta1zmax
□ ) for each informative component
□ = u, v and w. To that end, we calculate their relative energies as functions of /Delta1x, /Delta1z
and the wall-normal distance:
Eu
I (/Delta1x,/Delta1z, y) = ∥u2
I ∥
∥u2∥, Ev
I (/Delta1x,/Delta1z, y) = ∥v2
I ∥
∥v2∥, Ew
I (/Delta1x,/Delta1z, y) = ∥w2
I ∥
∥w2∥. (D1a–c)
The parametric sweep is performed using data for a channel ﬂow at Re = 180 in
a computational domain of size πh × 2h × π/2h in the streamwise, wall-normal and
spanwise directions, respectively.
Figure 21 displays Eu
I , Ev
I and Ew
I as functions of /Delta1x and /Delta1z.N o t e that due to the
symmetry of the ﬂow, Eu
I (/Delta1x,/Delta1z, y) = Eu
I (/Delta1x, −/Delta1z, y) (similarly for Ev
I and Ew
I ). For
Eu
I and Ev
I , the maximum is always located at /Delta1z = 0, which is the plane displayed in
ﬁgures 21(a,b). For the spanwise component, the maximum value of Ew
I is offset in the
spanwise direction , and its location varies with y. Figure 21 (c) displays the horizontal
section that contains its global maximum, which is located at y∗ ≈ 6. This offset is caused
by the fact that w motions travel in the spanwise direction until they reach the wall and
affect the wall shear stress.
Close to the wall, we ﬁnd high values of Eu
I ,w i t h peak value approximately 60 % at
y∗ ≈ 8, and /Delta1xmax
u ( y) ≈− h, following an almost linear relationship with y. Farther from
the wall ( y > 0.2h), /Delta1xmax
u becomes more or less constant, although it should be noted
that in this region, the values of Eu
I f o raﬁ x e dy are low and relatively constant. This may
induce some numerical uncertainty in the particular value of /Delta1xmax
u , but the overall results
are not affected. In contrast, high values of Ev
I are located in a compact region further away
from the wall (y∗ ≈ 19), and they tend to zero at the wall. The values /Delta1xmax
v ( y) lie close to
− 1.2h in this region, following a negative linear relationship with y. As before, /Delta1xmax
v ( y)
remains relative constant in low Ev
I regions. Finally, although not shown, /Delta1xmax
w ( y) and
/Delta1zmax
w ( y) lie in the intervals [− h, − 0.7h]a n d ±[0.1h, 0.2h], respectively, approaching
zero at the wall. Nevertheless, EI
w becomes negligible for y > 0.2h.
We close this appendix by noting that although not explored in the present study, /Delta1xmax
computed with aIND might correspond to potential locations for sensor placement, since
it maximises the mutual information with the target variable (Lozano-Durán & Arranz
2022).

Appendix E. Validity of aIND of u with respect to τx

0 ≈ 10 and
τx,+(x0 − /Delta1xmax
u − δx, z0 − /Delta1zmax
u − δz) as a function of δx = [δx,δz], denoted as
I(uR;τx,+)(δx). The mutual information is normalised by the total Shannon information
of the wall shear stress, H(τx), such that I(uR;τx,+)(δx)/H(τx) = 0 means that uR
contains no information about the wall shear stress at δx,a n d I(uR;τx,+)(δx)/H(τx) = 1
implies that uR contains all the information about τx,+(δx). Note that aIND seeks to
minimise I(uR;τx,+)(0). The results show that value of the I(uR;τx,+)(δx)/H(τx) remains
always low, reaching a maximum approximately 0.06 at δx ≈− 1.2h along the streamwise
direction. Hence we can conclude that the residual term contains a negligible amount
of information about the wall shear stress at any point in the wall , and aIND is a
valid approximation of IND. For the sake of completeness, we also display in ﬁgure 22
the mutual information between uI and the wall shear stress. Since τx,+ = F(uI),t h e
mutual information I(uI;τx,+)(δx) has to be equal to H(τx) at δx = 0, as corroborated
